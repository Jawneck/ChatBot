#About
This is the project assigned to us for Data Representation and Querying. The goal was to create a chatbot web application in Go. The user can access the chatbot via their browser. They can input text and will recieve a reply based on their choice of words. Example: "Hello my name is Danielis", the chatbot will reply to this with "Hello Danielis!".
